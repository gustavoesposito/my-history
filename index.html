                <h3>Birth/Nationality</h3>
                <p>I was born in São Paulo, Brazil, on 08/16/2004, I am a Brazilian with dual Italian nationality. My family arrived as Italian immigrants in Brazil in 1970. I grew up always a little distant from others, because I was always curious about technology, how things worked, I asked myself, "how was a security camera created?", "How did a iste work? ", " As a game was made, until in December 2015 I decided that I would learn to program, to make a security camera and put it in my room, since that day I never stopped programming, as a hobby, I did some freelance work for acquaintances, but I decided to start professionally, because now I am of legal age in Brazil, I grew up with great encouragement from my parents, they were always in favor of me doing everything I liked, I think that was the secret of everything until today, encouragement and a good education, faith, love, persistence and constancy</p>

                <p><strong>Why "the narrow door"?</strong><br>The narrow door for me means the hardest path, but what gives a more lasting success, with more learning, the most difficult, without effort, faith, hope we can't get through the door, they open a lot but when they see that it's very difficult to enter and go through it, when they see that it will be "hard to reach the end of the rainbow", the weak give up, try the wide door and end up being deceived by the ease of the comfort zone contained in it, a saying goes like this, "life is hard 'for those who are soft". That's why this title, at the narrow door you can't fool anyone, you can't be the "smartest", because that's not characteristics of those who are at the narrow door, and in the end life charges us with everything we've done, everything we we do, for good or ill</p>
                <p> <strong>Why I made this  site?</strong> <br>
                    Site made to show you that you want to hire me as a software developer, or you that want to know me
                    I chose to make this website, to show you, the world who I really am, where I came from, where I am, where I want to go. I want to show my professional and personal experiences, show everyone what I can do with programming, show why I chose to be a programmer, show the magic that moves the modern world, that moves companies, entertainment, money, social life, programming is in everything. To you reader, stop and think, how many things around you have programming? That's why I say that the modern world moves and tends only to grow, I hope you liked this site</p>
